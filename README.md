# Subtitle Adjuster
This program helps you to adjust your subtitle's timing. You can easily add or take off some delay in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or even hours.
It works with subtitles with ".srt" and ".txt" formats.
You just need to give the exact path with the name of the subtitle file "without the extention" and give as much as delay you want.

An example path could be:

  C:\Users\Baris\Desktop\New Folder\my_sub
  
Note: This was an example for a subtitle file named "my_sub.srt" or "my_sub.txt" in this path "C:\Users\Baris\Desktop\New Folder".
